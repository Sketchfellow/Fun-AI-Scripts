# Fun AI Scripts

Fun AI scripts are a collection of scripts that I made for fun using the Gemini API. I recommend using Gemini as it has a free plan that anyone can use. Be aware though that Google could use your data for training so I don’t recommend you using Gemini with sensitive information if you’re a free user. 

## Features:

- **Sentiment Analysis for CSV Data:** Analyze the sentiment of text data within a CSV file. Useful for understanding customer feedback, social media trends, and more!
- **Audio Transcription and Translation:** Transcribe audio files into text and then translate the text into a different language. Supports various audio formats like MP3, WAV, and FLAC.
- **More to come!**

## Prerequisites:

- Python 3.9+ to use Gemini. If you don't have it, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).   
- Install google-generativeai Python library using pip on your terminal:
  ```bash
  pip install -q -U google-generativeai
  ```  
- Get a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) for free.

## Usage:

Each script resides in its own subdirectory (e.g., `Scripts/Sentiment-Analysis/`) along with a dedicated README file.

**General Setup:**

1. **Navigate to a script's directory.**
2. **Download script:** Download the Python file of the script you want to use and place it to a directory.
4. **Edit the script:** Open the `.py` file (e.g., `GeminiSentimentAnalysis.py`) in a text editor.
5. **Provide your API Key:** Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual Gemini API key.
6. **Before running the script:** Follow the detailed, step-by-step instructions in the script's individual `README.md` file. These will provide further important instructions.
