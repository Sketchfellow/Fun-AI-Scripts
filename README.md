# Fun AI Scripts

Fun AI scripts are a collection of scripts that I made for fun using the Gemini API. I recommend using Gemini as it has a free plan that anyone can use. Be aware though that Google could use your data for training so I don’t recommend you using Gemini with sensitive information if you’re a free user. 

# Features:

- Sentiment Analysis for a CSV dataset.  
- More to come\!

# Prerequisites:

- Python 3.9+ to use Gemini  
- Install google-generativeai Python library
  ```bash
  pip install -q -U google-generativeai
  ```  
- Get a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

# Usage:

- Most of these scripts require you to edit some of the code.  
  - The sentiment analysis script requires you to change the value of the `sentimentColumn` variable to the correct index of the column you want to perform sentiment analysis on.
