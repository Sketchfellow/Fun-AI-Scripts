# Fun AI Scripts

Fun AI scripts are a collection of scripts that I made for fun using the Gemini API. I recommend using Gemini as it has a free plan that anyone can use. Be aware though that Google could use your data for training so I don’t recommend you using Gemini with sensitive information if you’re a free user. 

## Features:

- Sentiment Analysis for a CSV dataset.  
- More to come\!

## Prerequisites:

- Python 3.9+ to use Gemini. If you don't have it, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).   
- Install google-generativeai Python library using pip on your terminal:
  ```bash
  pip install -q -U google-generativeai
  ```  
- Get a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

## Usage:

- Most of these scripts require you to edit some of the code.
- The main edit is providing your Gemini API key within the script.
- For more usage instructions, see the `README` contained within each subdirectory containg that script you want to use.
